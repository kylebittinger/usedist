#' Compute the distance between group centroids

#' @param squared If \code{TRUE}, return the squared distance between centroids.
#' @return The distance between group centroids (see details).
#'
#' @details
#' If you have a distance matrix, and the objects are partitioned into groups,
#' you might like to know the distance between the group centroids. The
#' centroid of each group is simply the center of mass for the group.
#'
#' It is possible to infer the distance between group centroids directly from
#' the distances between items in each group.  The \code{adonis} test in the
#' ecology package \code{vegan} takes advantage of this approach to carry out
#' an ANOVA-like test on distances.
#'
#' The approach rests on the assumption that the objects occupy some
#' high-dimensional Euclidean space.  However, we do not have to actually
#' create the space to find the distance between centroids.  Based on the
#' assumption that such a space exists, we can use an algebraic formula to
#' perform the computation.
#'
#' The formulas for this were presented by Apostol and Mnatsakanian in 2003,
#' though we need to re-arrange equation 28 in their paper to get the value
#' we want:
#'
#' \deqn{| c_1 - c_2 | = \sqrt{
#'    \frac{1}{n_1 n_2} \sum_{(1,2)} -
#'    \frac{1}{n_1^2} \sum_{(1)} -
#'    \frac{1}{n_2^2} \sum_{(2)}},}
#'
#' where \eqn{n_1} is the number of samples in group 1, \eqn{\sum_{(1)}} is the
#' sum of squared distances between items in group 1, and \eqn{\sum_{(1,2)}} is
#' the sum of squared distances between items in group 1 and those in group 2.
#'
#' Sometimes, the distance between centroids is not a real number, because it
#' is not possible to create a space where this distance exists. Mathematically,
#' we get a negative number underneath the square root in the equation above.
#' If this happens, the function returns \code{NaN}. If you'd like to have
#' access to this value, you can set \code{squared = TRUE} to return the
#' squared distance between centroids. In this case, you will never get
#' \code{NaN}, but you might receive negative numbers in your result.

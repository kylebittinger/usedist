#' usedist: a package for working with distance matrices in R
#'
#' In usedist, we provide a number of functions to help with distance matrix
#' objects, such as those produced by the \code{dist} function.  Some functions
#' are geared towards making or altering distance matrix objects.  Others
#' relate to groups of items in the distance matrix. They provide access to
#' within- or between-group distances, or use these distances to infer the
#' distance to group centroids.

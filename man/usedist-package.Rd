\title{usedist: a package for working with distance matrices in R}
\description{
In usedist, we provide a number of functions to help with distance matrix
objects, such as those produced by the \code{dist} function.  Some functions
are geared towards making or altering distance matrix objects.  Others
relate to groups of items in the distance matrix. They provide access to
within- or between-group distances, or use these distances to infer the
distance to group centroids.
